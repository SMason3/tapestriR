# Overview
`tapestriR` is an R package for DNA + Analysis analysis of data generated by the Tapestri platform


Vignettes showing how to load data and performance analysis.

For these vignettes you'll need some additional libraries:
```
#various clustering methods including Louvain
BiocManager::install("scran")

packages <- c("factoextra",  "NbClust", 'uwot', 'ComplexHeatmap')

for(i in 1:length(packages)) {
  package = packages[i]
  if (!requireNamespace(package, quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages(package)

  require(package=package, character.only=TRUE)
}

```

# Objects

The multiomics object is a structured way to store all of the raw and normalized data as well as the analysis performed on these data. The object ensures that all of the multiomics data is properly aligned for cells and features of the cells.


### Multiomics Object
```
<root>
+-- metadata                          Experiment meta data. Required to have experiment_name
+-- assays
          +-- dna_variants            DNA Assay object
          +-- dna_read_counts         DNA read counts Assay object
          +-- protein_read_counts     Protein Read counts Assay object
          +--
+-- cell_annotations                  Annotation of each cell, Required to have barcode and sample name columns

```

#### `dna_variants` Assay Object
```
<root>
+-- assay_name                        Name of Assay. Same as one of the layers in the assays slot of Multiomics object
+-- data_layers                       1 or more layers of data. each layer must have same dimensions and matching cell barcodes (rows) and features (columns names) 
                +--NGT                Genotype layer. 0=WT, 1=HET, 2=HOM, 3=unknown
                +--AD
                +--GQ
+-- analysis_layers                   Additional layers after data is processed. Must have same number of cells (rows) 
                    +--               Examples: umap projection of each cell, or kmeans cluster labels
+-- feature_annotations               Annotations of features. Must have id column that is same as column names in data layers.
+-- cell_annotations                  Annotations of cells. Required to have barcode and sample name columns 
```

#### `protein_read_counts` Assay Object
```
<root>
+-- assay_name                        Name of Assay. Same as one of the layers in the assays slot of Multiomics object
+-- metadata                          Name of Assay. Same as one of the layers in the assays slot of Multiomics object
+-- data_layers                       1 or more layers of data. each layer must have same dimensions and matching cell barcodes (rows) and features (columns names) 
                +--read_counts        raw read counts per protein
                +--normalized         normalized read counts
                +--
+-- analysis_layers                   Additional layers after data is processed. Must have same number of cells (rows) 
                    +--
+-- feature_annotations               Annotations of features. Must have id column that is same as column names in data layers.
+-- cell_annotations                  Annotations of cells. Required to have barcode and sample name columns
